What is the Mawrid Reader
=========================

It is a HTML/JavaScript app for both desktop and mobile use that allows
looking up Arabic roots in Hans Wehr, Lane's Lexicon and other books simultaneously.

Additionally, you may download the entire contents to your hard disk or
smart phone's sd card, for fast offline usage. Read below for more
information on downloading and installing it.

Books currently included
========================

Root based dictionaries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

English
*******


HW: Hans Wehr
-------------

Started around WW2 and amended a few times since then, it is a very
concise dictionary listing some commonly found sayings. Its drawback is
that is focuses more on the language as it is found in print today with
all sorts of modern usages, making it difficult to find meanings
intended in older texts.

LL/LS: Lane's Lexicon + supplement
----------------------------------

This is a monumental work written in the 19th century, where the author
has gone through dozens of arabic sources and compiled a lot of relevant
examples for each root, from Quran, Hadeeth, poetry and proverbs. It is
extremely verbose which sometimes makes it difficult to find the
word you're looking for. The main work only goes up til the letter qaf,
and the supplement written after the author's death relies on his notes
and is therefore unfortunately lacking. Still extremely useful
nonetheless. In this website the supplement will close and open
automatically for you depending on whether you search for a root before
or after the letter qaf respectively.

SG: Steingass
-------------

This dictionary seems to fill the gap between Hans Wehr and Lane's
Lexicon in that it was also written in the 19th century and also focuses
on classical meanings. See for example the translation of 'to plough'
under IV of the root thwr (tha wow ra) which is not in Wehr but is
present in the lexicon. `Biography of the
author <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Joseph_Steingass>`_

BR: Brill
---------
A very good dictionary devoted to the roots found in the Quran giving statistics and translations of every root listed.

PR: A Dictionary and Glossary of the Koran by John Penrice
----------------------------------------------------------

An older dictionary also devoted to Quranic roots authored in the 19th century.

HA: Hava
--------

A very basic dictionary focusing on some more classical meanings.

AAN: Vocabulary Of The Holy Quran by Dr Abdullah Abbas Nadwi
------------------------------------------------------------

An extremely useful dictionary of the words in the Qur'an, compiled on the basis of their three-letter roots, allowing one to infer the meanings of almost all the different Qur'anic words by recognizing their root meaning. Examples of uses of the words in the Qur'an are also presented.

The Compiler: Dr. Abdullah Abbas Al-Nadwi is a graduate of the Nadwatul Ulema and an MA &PhD in Linguistic Philosophy, He is advisor to the Rabitah al-Alam al-Islamiyyah, Makkah, Member of the Liguistic Society Cambride and Professor at Umm al-Qura University Makkah. 

VI: Verbal Idoms of the Quraan by Mustansir Mir
-----------------------------------------------

An idiom is a phrase where the words together have a different meaning to the literal dictionary meaning of the words. For example, in English there are thousands, e.g. "a little bird told me", "a penny for your thoughts", "a picture is worth a thousand words", "add fuel to the fire" etc.
Similarly, in Arabic there are also thousands. The Quran uses several hundred, thus to truly understand and study The Quran, it is very important to be able to identify, study and understand its idiomatic expressions. This book does just that. It is a very unique study (I have not come across another book that does the same in English). It is a simple list and reference for The Quran's idiomatic usage. This book is recommended for anyone wishing to undertake a deeper and more accurate study of The Quran.

MGF: Dictionary Of The Holy Quran, by Malik Ghulam Farid, M.A
-------------------------------------------------------------

Caution: This dictionary was written by a Qadiani / Ahmadiyah.
However, the dictionary is useful and bias is very limited, it discusses mainly the basic root meaning in detail and also gives effects in shade when some other particles or words are combined with a derivative of such root and it contains unique and useful material on roots.  

Urdu
****

UQW: Urdu Qaamoos ul Waheed
--------------------------------------------------

Primarily based on the Arabic dictionary Mu'jam al Waseet which was compiled by a team of scholars in 20th century. Qaamoos ul Waheed is one of the largest available Arabic Urdu dictionaries. 

UMR: Urdu Mufraadaat Alfaaz al Qur'an by ar Raghib
--------------------------------------------------

This is the Urdu translation of the very famous and useful Mufraadaat Alfaaz al Qur'an al Kareem by Raaghib Asfahaany. 

UMS: Urdu Mukhtaar us Sihah
---------------------------

Mukhtaar us Sihaah written by al Raazi is a highly condensed abridgement of As Sihaah by Al-Jawhary with minor additions by him. Mostly words used in the Qur'an or Hadith were chosen by al Raazi in this book. This is Urdu translation of the book. 

UMJ: Urdu al Munjid
-----------------------

This is the Urdu translation by Ismat abu Saleem of the famous Arabic dictionary al Munjid written by Fr. Louis Ma’luf al-Yassu’i and Fr. Bernard Tottel al-Yassu’i, which has been printed, published, and distributed by a Catholic printing house since 1908. The Arabic dictionary has received some criticism from Muslim Scholars though it is still used widely. Though this is an Urdu translation by a Muslim and appears to have removed many of the concerns, still caution is advised. In Urdu, Al Munjid has been the source of 3 books. Misbaah ul Lughaat was actually based on this dictionary in which the translator removed some content and added some of his own content. The edition used in Almanac is claimed to be the 1st complete Urdu translation of Al Munjid.

Arabic
******

LA: Lisan al-'Arab
-----------------------
The Lisān al-ʿArab (لسان العرب, "The Arab Tongue") was completed by Ibn Manzur in 1290. Occupying 20 printed book volumes (in the most frequently cited edition), it is the most well-known dictionary of the Arabic language,[3] as well as one of the most comprehensive. Ibn Manzur compiled it from other sources, to a large degree.

Indonesion / Malaysian
**********************

IMN: Indonesia, Al-Munawwir, Kamus Arab-Indonesia Terlengkap, oleh KH. Ahmad Warson Munawwir
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kamus Al-Munawwir merupakan sebuah kamus bahasa Arab-Indonesia yang merupakan kamus bahasa Arab terlengkap, paling tebal dan legendaris di Indonesia. Kamus ini telah banyak digunakan oleh para penuntut ilmu (thullabul Ilmi) untuk mengetahui arti kosakata Arab ke dalam bahasa Indonesia juga sebagai acuan pada bendahara kosakata terjemahan kitab kuning. Kamus ini termasuk kategori best seller, karena telah dicetak berulangkali dan dicetak sekitar 10 ribu-15 ribu eksemplar pertahun. Untuk melengkapinya kamus ini kemudian diikuti edisi Indonesia-Arab-nya. Link: http://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Munawwir_(kamus)

MAR: Kamus Idris Al-Marbawi (Arabic-Malay) 
-------------------------------------------
Compiled by Sheikh Muhammad Idris Abdul Rauf Al-Marbawia, a Malay scholar born in Saudi Arabia. He spent most of his life facilitating the efforts of learning the Arabic books in many madrasa in Malaysia and finally in Al Azhar University in Egypt. Then, he began to compile the Arabic/Malay dictionary or more recognizable as Kamus Idris al-Marbawi, published in 1937. 

ULQ: Urdu Lughaat ul Qur'an by GA Parwez
----------------------------------------
This Arabic Urdu dictionary of the Qur'an has quoted material from some important works and many entries contain useful material. But since the author is a Sunnah rejector, he has inserted baseless material in few of the roots. Caution is advised. It contains some rare and useful material but this caution and his bias should be kept in mind.

UQA: Qaamoos alfaaz o Istelehaat e Qur'an
----------------------------------------- 
This dictionary is extracted from the notes on words given in the large Urdu Tafseer of The Qur'an Tadabbur e Qur'an by Amin Ahsan Islahi. The focus appears to be on giving meaning based on usage of the word in language.

UQQ: Urdu Qaamoos Alfaaz al Qur'an al Kareem
--------------------------------------------

Urdu Translation of Vocabulary of The Holy Qur'an by Abdullah Abbas Nadwi. Gives meanings of the roots and their related words. A brief yet useful book. Also gives brief grammatical notes. 

French
******

KAZ: Kazimirski, French Dictionnaire Arabe-Francais
---------------------------------------------------
This work has been the standard dictionary for translation of Arabic into French for many years. It contains most of the known roots of the Arabic language and also includes the dialects of Algiers and Morocco. Albert de Biberstein Kazimirski (1808-1887) was a lexicographer of repute in the nineteenth century. Among his many accomplishments was the translation of the Quran into French and the production of multiple dictionaries.

MAW: al-Mawrid 7th ed. by Rowhi Baalbaki 
----------------------------------------

Urdu
****

LQN: Lughaat ul-Quran by Abdur Rasheed Noumani (Urdu)
-----------------------------------------------------

The largest Arabic Urdu Dictionary of The Qur'an of about 2161 pages, but it is arranged according to words instead of roots. It gives meanings and explanations of the words along with brief grammatical information. It has explained some of the important words in great detail. 


How to use
==========

There is a really useful explanation page with screenshots here:
`http://revivearabic.blogspot.co.uk <http://revivearabic.blogspot.co.uk/p/using-arabic-almanac.html>`_

Below a short guide:

Click on the search button and enter the arabic root you would like to
look up. You can use roman (english) letters in case you don't have an
arabic keyboard. The letters will be replaced according to the following
table:

.. raw:: html

   <pre>
   Double letters:
   th/v/V -> "ث"       gh/g/G -> "غ"
   kh/x/X -> "خ"       sh/$ -> "ش"
   dh/* -> "ذ"

   Different cases:
   d -> "د"            t -> "ت"
   D -> "ض"            T -> "ط"
   z -> "ز"            h -> "ه"
   Z -> "ظ"            H -> "ح"
   s -> "س"
   S -> "ص"

   All other "normal" letters:
   a/A -> "ا"          q/Q   -> "ق"   
   b/B -> "ب"          k/K   -> "ك"
   j/J -> "ج"          l/L   -> "ل"
   7 -> "ح"            m/M   -> "م"
   r/R -> "ر"          n/N   -> "ن"
   w/W -> "و"          y/Y   -> "ي"
   f/F -> "ف"          e/E/3 -> "ع"
   </pre>

There are also some keyboard shortcuts you can use:

.. raw:: html

   <pre>
   search (find): f
   switch between column and full page view: v
   make pages fit to window: w

   The following keys only apply for the book you're currently looking at:
   back 1 page: left arrow, d or z
   forward 1 page: right arrow, g or x
   </pre>

Click on the 3 bar button on the top left to bring up a menu which allows you to change the order in which the books are displayed.

If you hide a book its images are not loaded during new searches, so this will improve the load time for the books that you do want to view.


Starting points:
================

Here are some links to get you started (TODO: Remaining morphology links for SG, BR, PR, HW4, AAN, VI):

-  `Prefaces <aa.html#HW3=5,LL=1_6,LS=2,HA=11,LS_HIDE,SG=6,BR=7,PR=8,HW4=4,AAN=6,VI=17>`_
-  `Morphology <aa.html#HW3=13,LL=1_29,LS=2,HA=19,LS_HIDE>`_
-  `Abbreviations <aa.html#HW3=16,LL=1_30,LS=2,HA=20,LS_HIDE,SG=18,BR=25,PR_HIDE,HW4=12,AAN=12,VI=13>`_
-  `First page of content <aa.html#HW3=19,LL=1_38,LS=3,HA=21,SG=20,BR=27,PR=10,HW4=14,AAN=24,VI=51>`_

   pages) <aa.html#HW3=5,LL=5_5,LS=2,HA=11,HW_HIDE,LS_HIDE,HA_HIDE,SG_HIDE,BR_HIDE,PR_HIDE,HW4_HIDE,AAN_HIDE,VI_HIDE>`_

Browser support
===============

I aim to make this website compatible with all major current desktop and mobile/tablet browsers, like Chrome, Firefox and Opera. However, I recommend against using Internet Explorer as this browser gives inconsistent behaviour when using this website.

Should work on most smart phones & tablets!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Depending on your screen resolution it will decide upon first load to
either use full width view or single column view mode, so that it should
select full view when you use this page on a largish desktop/tablet
screen but column mode if you access it using your smart phone. You can
always change the view manually with the 'View' button.

.. raw:: html

   <p>

Warning! With all books visible a single search may load up to 1-2 MB of images! Watch your internet usage allowance! Books that you hide won't have their images downloaded.

Download for offline use
========================

You can now download the entire website and install it for instance on
your phone's SD card or your desktop PC for super fast access. Download
link:

-  **Main download site @ archive.org:**
   `Arabic\_Almanac\_v4.0.zip <http://ia700803.us.archive.org/2/items/ArabicAlmanac/Arabic_Almanac_v4.0.zip>`_
-  Secondary backup site: `here <../Arabic_Almanac_v4.0.zip>`_\ 

The size is about 1.3 GB. The zip file contains a folder named "aa"
which you should place somewhere on your PC's drive or on your phone's
SD card. For desktops you should then be able to do "File->Open" and
select the index.html file within the "aa" folder. On smart phones &
tablets there are 2 ways you could try to get it installed: 1) Install the free Opera browser (the full one, not the Mini) to go the following url:
`file://localhost/sdcard <file://localhost/sdcard>`_, then locate the
"aa" folder and click on index.html or 2) Install the free Astro file manager and navigate to the aa folder that you've extracted from the zip file onto the sdcard. Tap the index.html file and it will either open in your default browser or you can choose any of the installed browser to open the file. Once in your browser you can bookmark it for quick access.

Future plans / Feedback
=======================

- Enhancements as well as bugs are now recorded in the Github issue list: `AA issues <https://github.com/ejtaal/aa/issues>`_


In order to include a book I would need an index of the page headers. I
have set up a page where you can input page headers easily, it has
already been used successfully by several volunteers for completing the
index of the Steingass book. Contact me at ejtaal@gmail.com for more
details. You can also contact me if you wish to discuss a custom made
version featuring your own books.
